### Background

Pac-Man is a classic arcade game released by Namco in 1980. This version of the game was written in JavaScript and uses the p5.js library for 2D rendering.

### How to Play

Navigate Pac-Man by using the `directional pad`. Collect all the pellets, and use caution as enemy ghosts will attempt to stop you in your tracks! You can defend against ghosts by eating Power Pellets to enter `Power Mode` which are located on the four corners of the grid. Press `P` to pause the game.

### Features

#### 2D Rendering & Collision Detection
All 2D rendering is done using the p5.js library, which is used to render objects in HTML Canvas. Since the `draw()` function is updated on every iteration, I used the always updating position of `Pac-Man` to determine if a collision was made against `Barriers`, `Pellets` or `Ghosts`.

Similar to the original Pac-Man, the player can queue a change in direction that will fire once the move becomes possible (ie. not blocked by a barrier).

```javascript
let target = grid[this.x + this.y * 28 + dx + dy * 28]
let oldTarget = grid[this.x + this.y * 28 + this.direction[0] + this.direction[1] * 28]

const wall = (type) => {
   return ["WALL", "GATE"].includes(type);
}

if(target && (!wall(target.type)) {
  this.direction = newDirection
} else if (target && wall(target.type) && !wall(oldTarget.type)) {
  this.direction
} else if(target && wall(target.type)) {
  this.direction = [0, 0];
}
```

#### Ghost AI
Staying true to the original Pac-Man, ghost movements involve chasing Pac-Man, visiting 'their' corner of the board, and random scattering during `Power Mode`.

Both chasing and visiting mode involve calculating the shortest distance to Pac-Man and their corner respectively. Time is used to alternate between the two different modes. For 6 seconds, a ghost will be in visiting mode. After which, the ghost will enter chasing mode. This is repeated until the level is complete or the game is over.

Random scattering only occurs during `Power Mode` which involves choosing a random possible path and moving in that direction. This lasts for 12 seconds.

```javascript
let goToX = time > 6 ? pacX : this.cornerX;
let goToY = time > 6 ? pacY : this.cornerY;

if(!this.powerMode) {
  possibleDirections.forEach(dir => {
    let posSum;
    posSum = Math.sqrt((this.x + dir[0] - goToX)**2 + (this.y + dir[1] - goToY)**2)
    if(posSum < dirSum && this.moving !== false) {
      dirSum = posSum;
      newDirection = dir;
    }
  });
}
```
